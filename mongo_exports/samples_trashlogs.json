Dave, Tammie, Raoul, Tammie, Matt on the same shift but  are reporting separately.  \nThe Wildmile, Turning Basin and around Goose Island was lightest we've seen in a long while...only a handful trash.  Interesting finds of a thick metal plate, a wicker chair frame and large candle (we no longer have candle as a category, putting under food because of wax possible animal origins).\nHOWEVER as soon as we congratulated our cleaning efforts we spied down the channel a long strip of still water starting under the Chicago Ave bridge...That block long strip was a real mess, probably sewer overflow. Lori and Kurt spent an hour just in that spot and only made a dent.\n",
